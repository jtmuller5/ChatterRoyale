# Way-2-Say
Kill cliche and find quirky ways to say the simple things.

## What's the reason?
We're all aware of that synonyms chart they hand out in middle school...you know, the one that has two columns.<br>

| Instead of this.... | ..say this  |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Good                | Marvelous   |
| Said   | Bellowed |

For the most part, this chart was unusable in everyday life since no one wanted hear how "marvelous" your day was. Even still, it was fun to sprinkle flavor onto a normally mundane sentence and I'm sure kids that used the chart scored higher in English class.<br><br>

Interestingly enough, I never saw one of these tables for basic sayings or sentences. Wouldn't the world sound a bit more creative if this existed?

| Instead of this.... | ..say this  |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| I'm tired   | My tolerance for consciousness is waning  |
| My head hurts | It feels like there's a race war going on between the white and grey matter in my brain |

Is this a necessary addition to the world? No. But, will it be fun to use? Maybe.

## How will the chart be generated?
I'll admit that I'm not personally a fountain of unique ideas. Or at least I don't have enough ideas to do this alone. So, with that said, the chart will be the product of everyone who uses the Way 2 Say app.<br>Each day, a new prompt will be presented to the community: a simple saying or expression, a general question, something you've probably heard a thousand times in your lifetime. Given the prompt, users will then contribute their own alternatives to a central feed where others can vote on each entry's uniqueness and relevancy.<br>At the end of each day, points will be awarded to the users that had the highest scoring contributions. The prompt and all of its alternate manifestations will then be saved off to a repository.

## Can submissions be made to a prompt after the daily competition has closed?
Yep! The main feed will be used to present everyone with a new prompt each day but all prompts will remain active beyond the day's close. This way, all synonym charts will continue to grow and the "utility" of the app will increase over time.
