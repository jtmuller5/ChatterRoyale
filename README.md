# Way-2-Say
Kill cliche and find quirky ways to say the simple things.

## What's the reason?
We're all aware of that synonyms chart they hand out in middle school...you know, the one that has two columns.<br>

| Instead of this.... | ..say this  |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Good                | Marvelous   |
| Said   | Bellowed |

For the most part, this chart was unusable in everyday life since no one wanted hear how "marvelous" your day was. Even still, it was fun to sprinkle flavor onto a normally mundane sentence and I'm sure kids that used the chart scored higher in English class.<br><br>

Interestingly enough, I never saw one of these tables for basic sayings or sentences. Wouldn't the world sound a bit more creative if this existed?

| Instead of this.... | ..say this  |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| I'm tired   | My tolerance for consciousness is waning  |
| My head hurts | It feels like there's a race war going on between the white and grey matter in my brain |

Is this a necessary addition to the world? No. But, will it be fun to use? Maybe.

## How will the chart be generated?
